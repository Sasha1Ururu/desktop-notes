# For Plasma 6, ensure KF_VERSION is set appropriately if using KF6 features,
# or adjust find_package for KF6 and Qt6. This CMakeLists.txt is more KF5/Qt5 oriented.
# For a pure Python/QML plasmoid, the core installation logic is about placing files correctly.
# If this were Plasma 6, find_package(KF6Plasma) and find_package(Qt6 ...) would be used.
# And ${KF6_PLUGINS_INSTALL_DIR}
# For now, assuming a KF5/Qt5 environment based on PyKDE5 usage.
# If it's Plasma 6, PyKDE5 is not the right binding. It would be PyQt6 and direct D-Bus or similar.
# The problem description specifies "KDE Plasma 6", which means this CMake and Python bindings are problematic.
# PyKDE5 is for KF5. For Plasma 6 (KF6), Python plasmoids are still possible but bindings change.
# Let's assume the environment can handle PyKDE5 for now, or this is a conceptual Python part.
# Given the "no run" constraint, this is more about file structure.
# For Plasma 6, the python bindings would likely be via `PyQt{5|6}` and `dbus-python` or similar, not `PyKDE5`.
# However, the `Applet` class structure from `PyKDE5.Plasma.Plasmoid` is specific.
# This suggests a potential mismatch in the problem spec vs. typical Plasma 6 Python development.
# I will proceed with the CMake structure for file installation, acknowledging this binding concern.

# Final check on paths for X-Plasma-MainScript: "contents/code/main.py"
# CMake install path for code: ${PLASMA_APPLET_INSTALL_DIR}/${PLUGIN_ID}/contents/code/
# This matches.
# CMake install path for QML: ${PLASMA_APPLET_INSTALL_DIR}/${PLUGIN_ID}/contents/ui/
# This is also standard.
