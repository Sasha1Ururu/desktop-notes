# Relevant for Plasma 6, indicates the plasmoid is QML based and uses a specific entry point.
# If purely Python and not using a QML wrapper:
# X-Plasma-API=pythonscript might be sufficient, but often Python Applets also have a QML part.
# For a pure Python Applet without QML for its main structure:
# The structure often involves a Python file that defines a class inheriting from Plasma.Applet.
# Let's assume a structure that would be common for Python plasmoids.
# The main script will be responsible for setting up the plasmoid.
# Some Python plasmoids use a thin QML wrapper to load the Python part.
# e.g. main.qml loads a Python plugin.
# For now, focusing on the Python side.
# The X-Plasma-MainScript points to the entry Python file.
# The actual Python environment within Plasma provides the Plasma bindings.
